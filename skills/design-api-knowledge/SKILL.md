# design-api-knowledge

## Trigger guidance
Use this skill when requests involve:
- design tokens, component behavior, or visual consistency
- API contracts, validation, error formats, or integration rules
- documenting product/technical conventions for reuse

## Workflow
1. Open `references/design-system.md` for design rules.
2. Open `references/api-standards.md` for API conventions.
3. Open `references/product-glossary.md` for shared language.
4. Apply only relevant sections to the active task.
5. If repetitive checks are needed, run scripts from `scripts/`.

## Notes
- Keep this file concise.
- Put deep details and examples in `references/` files.
